# scripts
__Collection of (usually) one-off scripts or programs__

This repository contains various scripts or programs I have written over the years for fun or for specific use cases (one-off scripts). This repository exists mainly for historical purposes, as I rarely go back and make changes to one-off scripts. Feel free to use these scripts if you find any of them useful (though I doubt it :P).

All scripts in this respository are provided under the MIT license unless otherwise specified in the source file (usually the license in the source file is more permissive).
